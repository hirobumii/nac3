# NAC3

NAC3 is a major, backward-incompatible rewrite of the compiler for the [ARTIQ](https://m-labs.hk/artiq) physics experiment control and data acquisition system. It features greatly improved compilation speeds, a much better type system, and more predictable and transparent operation.

NAC3 has a modular design and its applicability reaches beyond ARTIQ. The ``nac3core`` module does not contain anything specific to ARTIQ, and can be used in any project that requires compiling Python to machine code.

**WARNING: NAC3 is currently experimental software and several important features are not implemented yet.**

## Packaging

NAC3 is packaged using the [Nix](https://nixos.org) Flakes system. Install Nix 2.4+ and enable flakes by adding ``experimental-features = nix-command flakes`` to ``nix.conf`` (e.g. ``~/.config/nix/nix.conf``).

## Try NAC3

After setting up Nix as above, use ``nix shell github:m-labs/artiq/nac3`` to get a shell with the NAC3 version of ARTIQ. See the ``examples`` directory in ARTIQ (``nac3`` Git branch) for some samples of NAC3 kernel code.

## For developers

This repository contains:
- ``nac3ast``: Python abstract syntax tree definition (based on RustPython).
- ``nac3parser``: Python parser (based on RustPython).
- ``nac3core``: Core compiler library, containing type-checking and code generation.
- ``nac3standalone``: Standalone compiler tool (core language only).
- ``nac3artiq``: Integration with ARTIQ and implementation of ARTIQ-specific extensions to the core language.
- ``runkernel``: Simple program that runs compiled ARTIQ kernels on the host and displays RTIO operations. Useful for testing without hardware.

Use ``nix develop`` in this repository to enter a development shell.
If you are using a different shell than bash you can use e.g. ``nix develop --command fish``.

Build NAC3 with ``cargo build --release``. See the demonstrations in ``nac3artiq`` and ``nac3standalone``.
